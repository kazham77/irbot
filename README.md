# irbot
This is a small project that allows you to create a shortcuts on your IR remote control.

Almost every IR remote control contains buttons that have no any practical use for you.
You can convert these buttons into shortcuts for functions that are hard to reach, but very
important for you. For example, on my Toshiba TV, when I need to turn the backlight off and
save some energy during ads, I need to press Home button, then after 6s Left button, then
Up, Left, Left, Ok, Left, Ok. Obviously, this is suboptimal. I choose button B on my
IR remote control to substitute all these buttons and delays between presses. So when I
press B button, the device emits all those mentioned IR codes and turns my screen off.

Firmware was made for ESP12F based boards, but, obviously, can be adopted almost for every
ESP device.
